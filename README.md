# basicTableMVC

Back to basics! 

This project is intended as a very bare-bones example of a tableview that loads information into cells from a remote API.

Most of my projects use tableviews, of course, but they aren't good to use as examples for beginners because they often include distracting code that implements custom UI or button actions.

This tableview uses the same server-side Swift API featured in the tarotReader project. It is more or less the same as the tarotReader in terms of the API calls, the only difference being that the cards are presented in table cells instead of UIViews.
