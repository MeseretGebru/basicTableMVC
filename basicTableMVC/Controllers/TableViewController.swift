        // You learned to set up the APIManager as a singleton, then called a class function on it to make the actual API request. Below is an alternate way, called dependency injection. With a singleton, the manager always exists as soon as the app loads -- we just have to use it. Here, we make an instance of APIRequestManager when we create the view we are using it with, then hand the view controller the manager so it can make the API request.
        
        //  Using a singleton ensures we never have multiple APIRequestManagers running & causing weird bugs. However, the dependency injection approach makes it easier to debug the view controller -- if there's a problem, we can just plug in another instance of the APIRequestManager class and see how it runs. Singletons are more difficult to debug because they tend to take over everything...and if one thing breaks, everything else breaks with it

But we always need to update the UI on the main thread! What gives? All views inherit from UIApplication, and UIApplication is set up on the main thread. Therefore, we are ALREADY on the main thread, by doing our updates inside this method on a view. See https://www.quora.com/Why-must-the-UI-always-be-updated-on-Main-Thread

Try it out for yourself and see.
